# LinkedDataIntegrationTool

## Introduction

This web-based application 
collects different pieces of heterogeneous data from various sources and integrates them. The integration 
process includes four major steps: data collection, schema transformation, entity – resolution, data storage
and SPARQL querying over the dataspace. The application converts non-RDF data to RDF using a content unaware 
algorithm, translates different schemas into a single local schema and links same entities. It is based on 
a simple user interface and the open source R2R and Silk Frameworks. The imported pieces of data form 
different datasets that shape a single data space to which SPARQL queries can be executed. The main 
contribution of the application is that users are able to combine - with little effort - pieces of 
heterogeneous data and extract useful information from them.
